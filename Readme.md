# README

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions. The goal is to improve problem-solving skills and build a strong foundation in DSA concepts.

## Content
I will be solving DSA questions from this video:

Each solution will be accompanied by an **intuition.md** file explaining the thought process behind the approach.

## Structure
- Each problem will have its own directory containing:
  - The solution (code)
  - An explanation which also includes link to the original leetcode question (intuition.md)

## Goals
- Strengthen problem-solving skills.
- Prepare for coding interviews.
- Learn and implement efficient algorithms.
